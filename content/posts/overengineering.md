# Overengineering
I have been interested in fullstack development for a long time. 
There is something very special about being able to build a complete application with a good looking frontend, a fast performance and implementing all the features that you wish an application would have.
The problem is, that I found it very hard to get into fullstack development, due to the fact, that many ressources try to teach you web development for Fortune 500 companies, which need their software to handle millions of users and requests, with no downtime at all and the ability to scale endlessly.
